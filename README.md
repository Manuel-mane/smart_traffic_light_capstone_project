# smart_traffic_light_capstone_project

This project is part of the Capstone I program of the bachelor of Telecommunications Technology Engineering. This is an arduino based software.

Objectives
Development of a traffic light system that is capable to adapt to traffic conditions and to adjust light patterns. Additionally, first responders will be able to communicate 
with the system and overwrite light sequence, if necessary, to clear their way.

Requirements:
Arduino C++
Arduino IDE
Arduino Mega 2560 platform, 
Arduino Mega 2560 Drivers
Arduino wireless module, 
IR sensors
Electronic elements such as LEDs, resistors and LCD screen
